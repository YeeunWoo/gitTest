        I don't know what you've been told<br>
        But time is running out, no need to take it slow<br>
        I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe<br>
        I should be scared, honey, maybe so<br>
        But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)<br>
        Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)<br>
        Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it<br>
        I don't know what you've been told<br>
        But time is running out so spend it like it's gold<br>
        I'm living like I'm nine-zeros<br>
        Got no regrets even when I'm broke (yeah)<br>
        I'm at my best when I got somethin' I'm wanting to steal<br>
        Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel, yeah-yeah<br>
        No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal<br>
        I'll take it in and let it go<br>
        But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)<br>
        Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)<br>
        Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ohh, ooh (I ain't worried)<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (oh, no, no)<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)<br>
        Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)<br>
        Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it<br>
        I ain't worried 'bout it<br>
